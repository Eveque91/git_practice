# Welcome to my Test Project on GitHub Pages

I am a new student and trying out this feature for the first time. I am creating the content for this Page using Markdown that I have just recently learned about !  

I have some _very_ basic knowledge of Java and C++ and I am currently in the process of learning how to use Git & Github.

## C++ 

I have completed the codecademy course on C++ during which I created short programs such as Space Weight, Text Adventure, Whale Talk and UFO. 

- Space Weight is a very basic program that uses **arithmetic operators** to calculate your weight on other planets using your earth weight. 
- Text Adventure is a small program that uses **conditional statements** to tell a story based on user input. 
- Whale Talk is a program that transforms any word or sentence a user inputs to "whale talk", by taking out all of the consonants and doubling some of the vowels. The program uses **loops and arrays**.
- UFO is a more challenging program that allows the user to play a game of hangman. A random 10 character word is chosen out of 10 different possibilities each time the user plays. It combines the use of **arithmetic operators, conditional statements, loops and arrays**.

For more information on their C++ course, see [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus).

## Java 

I have also completed _another codecademy course_ to build basic android apps using Java and Android Studio. At the end of this course I created an android mobile app called "Unquote".

During this course I have learned : 

1. _Basic_ Java principles and syntax
2. How to use the _basic features_ of Android Studio
3. The _basics of XML_ (Extensible Markup Language) 
4. _Logging and error management_ in Android Studio
5. Running an android Studio project on a _personal device_.

### Conclusion

If you are reading this then (_**WHY?**_) this means that you have read my Github Page and I thank you for sticking with me for this far. I know this isn't much, but I will try to keep at it and improve my page over time (or maybe even create a new one) with some new and hopefully more ambitious projects.
